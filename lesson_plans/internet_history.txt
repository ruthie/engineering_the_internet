Two questions about each of these:
*how is information encoded
*how do we get it to the right destination


First communication over wires:

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Two kids with cans and a string between them (who played with these?)
*produce a signal
*translate it into something that goes over a wire
*translate it back
(used to be called lovers phone)
transmission via vibration of string
BRING ONE OF THESE IN
Things to notice:  
*distortion in the wire
*abstraction-- signal in, signal out
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Telegraph
kids -> grownups
sound waves -> electric signal

More important:  DIGITAL ABSTRACTION
ask students:  what does digital actually mean?  1s and 0s --> contrast to continuous signal on tin can telephone

basically a point-to-point communication technology, although later more complicated systems were built on it

Question:  do you still get distortion?  yes!  what form does it come out as?  switched 1s and 0s.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Telephones

"apparatus for transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically"
must have been the coolest thing ever when it was invented

Have you ever seen a telephone switchboard, like in a museum?
Why do they end up in museums?  Because there are a ton of them and they're not very useful.

circuit-switching network
Q:  What did telephone operators do?
A:  litterally connected circuits.

advantages and disadvantages

When you talk on the phone today, 

------------------------------------

ARPANET

computer communication over the telephone network
had "leased [telephone] lines"
I don't know exactly what IO hardware looked like

Big idea:  packet switching
Idea 1:  have a big network of wires, like a network of roads
each node knows (somehow*) where to send the information to get to it's destination (same way long distance telephone works)

replace people routing phones with machines routing messages
preface each message with an address

Idea 2:  what if someone hogs the line?
     break up information into chunks, each of which has adress information prepended

*I don't want to treat this question in full as part of this course, but basically, routers (internal nodes in the network) advertise routes they know to other nodes
-------------------------------

Modern internet

Q:  how do you get wires into people's homes
A:  use existing infrastructure

Dial up internet, later cable internet using cable television infrastructure

literally put your phone on a little box and use direct dialling to connect you to your provider

cable internet uses television infrastructure
