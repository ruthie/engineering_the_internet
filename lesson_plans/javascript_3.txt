Already know how to:
--------------------
*write a function
*attach it to a button
*give your function arguments
*change position of an element
*do a thing periodically, stop doing it periodically
*declare a variable

Today:
------
*modifying html content
	   document.getElementById("bla").innerHTML = "write what goes in the tags here"
	   document.getElementById("bla").appendChild(node)
	   
	   appendchild requires a node--
	   create a node using document.createElement("tag") <- no angle brackets, just the tag name

exercise:  use only javascript to create the body af a page.

*loops
for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++){
	//more javascript code
}

while(i < 10) { 
	// more javascript code
}


*if statements
if(i < 10){
}

exercise:  make a multiplication table programmatically (you should have two loops, one inside the other)

----------------------------
How to learn more javascript
----------------------------
clearly I have not listed all of the things you could ever want to do
Javascript does lots of things, some are more complicated than others

Javascript resources:
*www.w3schools.com/js
*go to a page that does the thing you want to do and look at it's javascript
    use chrome developer tools -> sources tab to find javascript source
        chrome developer tools -> elements tab to look at HTML
*use javascript console to test new javascript (chrome developer tools -> console)
*google the thing you want to do and see if anyone on the internet knows how to do it
