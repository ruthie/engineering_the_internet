TCP/IP:  layered protocols

Ideas: 
Definition of a protocol
Packets wrapped in other packets.  Don't care what inner packets do from point of view of outer packets.
What various layers do

other:
Not everything falls into a layer.
Tool for thinking about the system.  Reality is more complicated.
Use wireshark to unwrap some packets and see what's inside?


Protocol:  set of rules for communicating within a computer system
-syntax and semantics
-formally defined
-you can think of them like the rules for writing any computer code (or using the command line)
-we'll see lots of examples tomorrow

1.  general idea:  
have different protocols for dealing with different functions
wrap one protocol inside of another

We talked about packets-- most packets have headers and a payload-- which is another packet

encapsulation-- we don't know what's on the inside

2.  
advantages of layering scheme
-- only have to worry about one part of the system at a time
-- independence of different layers-- can choose the most appropriate protocol at each layer

disadvantages
-- not always efficient (might have to have some pieces of information in multiple layers)

3.  descriptions of actual layers
3a. link
one "hop"
ethernet, wireless protocols
how do you share a "medium"

3b. internet
ip addresses
"best effort network"

3c. transport
TCP
-- reliable delivery
-- error checking
-- encryption
-- an idea of a connection, (multiplexing)
-- in order delivery
UDP  some subset of the above 


3d. application
HTTP
SSH
