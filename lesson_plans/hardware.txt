Hardware

Ask for parts of a computer

Hardware vs. Software
	 *if you can touch it, it's hardware
	 *if you program it, it's software
	 *most of what we'll talk about in this class is software
	 *software is really subject to what hardware can and can't do
	    -we've abstracted over a lot of things, so you can write software, even good software, without thinking about hardware constraints

Hardware
*hard drive
*processor
*memory
*io devices:  most are optional!
       -keyboard
       -mouse
       -usb ports
       -ethernet port/wireless card
*bus

Processor:
	*arithmetic/and/or/xor/bitshift/multiplication
	*reads strings of 1s and 0s out of memory and puts them back in
	*sends and receives 1s and 0s on the bus
	*choose it's next instruction
	*machines often very different

32 vs. 64 bit
processes 4 vs 8 bytes at a time

Of particular interest to this class are peripherals, particularly network
Most computers have a network card.  
     *another peripheral io device-- looks like a keyboard + text display to the computer
     *implements data link layer circuitry -- takes ones and zeros and turns them into voltages on an ethernet cord

At this point it should astound you that we get anything done at all.
   *Although all computers have same basic components, they look /very/ different
   *Ton of unstructured information
