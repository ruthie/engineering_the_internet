\section{Color Picker}
Write the javascript for a simple page where you can input a color (either ithe name of a color, or the hex code for a color) and the page background turns the color you entered.


I've provided the html.  All you need is to write the file \texttt{color\_picker.js}.


\subsection*{Getting started}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Click on the link on the class webpage for the color-picker HTML
and save it on your desktop as \texttt{color\_picker.html}.
\item Open the file you just saved in a browser.  Try changing the color.  It shouldn't work.
\item Open a text editor and make a file called \texttt{color\_picker.js}.  Write your javascript there.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Debugging advice}
\begin{itemize}
\item To test whether a function is being called, put an \texttt{alert} in it.
\item To test what a particular variable's value is somewhere, use \texttt{alert([variabl\_name])}.
\end{itemize}

Turn in your javascript via email so I can test it.
