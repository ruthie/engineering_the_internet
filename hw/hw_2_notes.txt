MIT often got people an address that started with 23.

Harvard.edu 
Lots of good possible answers
*lost packets -- pretty unlikely 

*site down/too much traffic -- can we reach it via a web browser

*incorrect ip address

*we don't have access
    well, ping doesn't really do the authentication thing.

*firewall -- hard to say, but if this were it we'd probably expect every computer within Harvard to be unreachable
seas.harvard.edu is not

*is configured not to respond to pings.

If you ping from Athena, local addresses are probably faster, but things far away are dominated by the distance.

traceroute:  I screwed this one up
