\section*{CSS Zen Garden}
The CSS designs featured on CSS Zen Garden are by professional graphic designers.  However, there's nothing to stop you from making your own, it just won't get published.  Except maybe in class.


\section*{Alternate assignment}
Prototype a new design for some other website.  Run the site by me before starting work.  Not every website is a good choice.  You need something with a lot of content, but not too much javascript.  A lot of websites 

The CSS Zen Garden will be easier to write CSS for because the writers of the page have done a very consistent job of marking each element with an appropriate class.  You also have many different examples of CSS already written for the Zen Garden, whereas for any other website, you'll only have one.

Some ideas of websites:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The ESP Website (esp.mit.edu)
\item Reddit
\item Your school's webpage (depending on how awesome that is)
\end{enumerate}

\section*{What to turn in}

\section*{Advice}

Choose a static page (like esp.mit.edu/learn/Junction/index.html) and save a copy on your computer.  Most browsers will save the page along with a folder full of files, both CSS and javascript.
